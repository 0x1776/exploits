## Infrequently Asked Questions.

1. Why is there no leet zerodays?

   Because some of our researchers don't believe in killing bugs prematurely, and our policy on disclosure is that it is at the sole discretion of the person who finds the bug.
2. Why don't you just write metasploit modules?

   Reasons, namely, "ruby", amongst other things.
3. Why are there some old bugs in here?

   The public exploits available for them were unreliable/untrustworthy/rubbish and better ones were called for, or, they are parts of ongoing experiments into various methods to make them more reliable/stealthy/whatever.

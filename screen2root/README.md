# screen2root

## TL;DR
On systems where screen is version 4.5.0 (Screen version 4.05.00 (GNU) 10-Dec-16), and setuid root, you can use it to create arbritary files with root permissions containing arbritary content.

This PoC creates an /etc/ld.so.preload file pointing to a library that creates a setuid root shell and then calls screen again to trigger it.

TL;DR you get root.

# Contribution Guidelines

* All exploits must be tested and reliable all of the time. No shitty "works on my box" bullshit like other people. If an exploit does not work, file an issue so that can be fixed.
* All exploits must be accompanied by a demo, asciicast, screenshot, or video are acceptable.
* No fucking ruby because I cannot read ruby.
* Don't take this too seriously.
